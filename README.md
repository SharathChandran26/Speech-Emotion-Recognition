# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
This project aims to determine human emotions from their voice. The primary goals include improving accuracy and reducing the model's weight. I am carefully ensuring not to increase the model's weight as I plan to implement this code on TinyML. My initial step is to design the model in TensorFlow, followed by conversion to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on TinyML.
